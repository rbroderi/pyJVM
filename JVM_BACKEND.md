# Modern classfile backend

Generated classes and the support runtime target **Java 21 / classfile major
65 only**. The compiler writes classes and `StackMapTable` directly in Python;
it does not use a JVM postprocessor or javac to regenerate user code.

```bash
python -m pyjvm315.cli examples/hello.py -o build/jvm -c Hello
java -Xverify:all -cp build/jvm Hello
javap -v -cp build/jvm Hello
python -m pyjvm315.conformance tests/conformance --python python3.15
```

`compile_source`, `compile_file`, `Compiler` and `ClassFile` retain `target=21`
for explicit validation; all older targets are rejected. The target propagates
to every imported module. Runtime compilation uses `javac --release 21`.
These are non-preview classfiles (minor 0); Java 21 or newer is required.
Legacy verifier-inference serialization is removed, so every method goes through
frame analysis, including straight-line methods with an empty frame table.

## Frame analysis

`pyjvm315/stackmap.py` decodes the final instruction stream after label fixups
and computes a fixed point over normal branches/fallthrough and exception-table
edges. The initial frame comes from the descriptor and static/instance access;
constructors start with `uninitializedThis`. Values track verifier types:
Object references and arrays, null, int-valued boolean results, top/unassigned
locals, and allocation-site uninitialized objects. Constructor invocation
replaces all aliases of the initialized receiver. Long/double descriptors have
category-2 widths, though primitive arithmetic/local opcodes are not emitted
or supported by this tranche.

Joins preserve matching types, merge null into a reference, conservatively
merge distinct reference classes to Object, and make incompatible/unassigned
locals top. Stack-height or incompatible operand-stack joins are errors.
Typed reference uses that need precision must supply an explicit cast; no
external class hierarchy is loaded to infer common ancestors.

Handlers get the protected instruction's **incoming locals** and one exception
value, independent of the incoming operand stack. Catch-all handlers receive
Throwable. Branch targets and reachable handlers receive full frames with
correct offset deltas and trailing-top trimming. The implicit entry frame is
not duplicated. Constants/classes for frames enter the constant pool **before**
it is serialized. Empty tables are emitted for straight-line modern methods.

Dead regions left after return/throw/goto are rewritten at identical byte
offsets to nop padding ending in athrow, with synthetic Throwable frames.
Their ranges are excluded from exception tables so synthetic locals cannot
pollute reachable handlers. Live offsets and branches stay unchanged; only
unreachable instructions are replaced. Full-frame encoding is deliberately
simple initially; compressed frame encodings can follow independently.

Modern methods derive `max_stack` from their dataflow rather than retaining the
old blanket 128. Local accesses beyond slot 255 use JVM `wide`, and local/code
size bounds fail explicitly. Unsupported opcodes, malformed branch/handler
boundaries, truncated instructions, stack underflows and reads of top locals
fail with a `FrameError`. This analyzer supports the backend's emitted subset;
it is not a complete arbitrary-JVM-bytecode verifier or a Python type prover.
New opcodes must have transfer rules before modern emission can use them.

## Validation and next steps

The conformance runner always executes Java with `-Xverify:all`. Compatibility
CI runs the full focused corpus on target 21. Backend verification never
changes Python semantic lowering, nested/local-class support, or runtime object
representation. Tests also load classes with branches/joins, nulls, dead blocks,
exception handlers, wide locals and newly initialized objects under strict
verification, and check target propagation to imported modules.

The existing benchmark harness needs no special path: it compiles with the new
default and compares against its base compiler using the same workloads. Build
and verification cost remain outside kernel timing. Generated and runtime
classfiles both use major 65, regardless of the host JDK version.

Next backend work should extend the typed instruction model before adding
primitive locals/arithmetic, then support long/double constants, branch
widening and compressed frames. Modern targets and valid frames provide the
foundation; they are not themselves a claim of near-Java speed.

The encoding and verifier rules follow the Java Virtual Machine Specification,
sections 4.1, 4.7.4 and 4.10:
